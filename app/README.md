# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

# ABI in Smart Contracts

ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. In the context of smart contracts, the ABI is a specification of the interface of the contract, which defines how the contract can be interacted with.

The ABI describes the methods and properties of the contract, their argument types and return values, and the events that can be emitted by the contract. The ABI is used by client applications to interact with the contract on the blockchain.

The ABI is typically generated by the compiler when the contract is compiled. It can also be manually defined using tools such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

Here's an example ABI for a simple smart contract that implements a counter:

``` [
  {
    "constant": false,
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "increment",
    "outputs": [],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "constant": true,
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "getCount",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "payable": false,
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "name": "value",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "CounterIncremented",
    "type": "event"
  }
]
```

This ABI describes a contract with two methods: `increment`, which increments the counter, and `getCount`, which returns the current value of the counter. The contract also emits an event called `CounterIncremented` when the counter is incremented.

Note that the ABI is represented as a JSON array of objects, with each object representing a method, property, or event of the contract. The objects have various fields that describe the details of the method, property, or event, such as its name, inputs, outputs, and type.

# Atoms.js
This is a module written in JavaScript that exports a series of `atom` objects using the `recoil` library, which is a state management library for React applications.

Each `atom` object represents a piece of state in the application that can be used and updated by components. Here is a brief explanation of each of the exported `atom` objects:

- `login`: represents the user's authentication status (whether they are logged in or not).
- `popups`: represents the text content of a popup message that can be displayed to the user.
- `buyerAddress`: represents the Ethereum address of the buyer.
- `productId`: represents the ID of a product in the blockchain.
- `productIdHome`: represents the ID of a product on the home page.
- `secretId`: represents the secret ID of a product.
- `fall`: represents the fall state of a product.
- `newOwner`: represents the Ethereum address of a new owner for a product.

Each `atom` has a key and a default value. The key is a unique identifier for the `atom` and the default value is the initial value of the state when the application is loaded.

These `atoms` can be used by components to read and update the state of the application in a predictable and manageable way.

# web3Provider
The `provider` object has the following properties:

- `contractAddress`: The Ethereum address of the smart contract being interacted with.
- `buyAddress`: The Ethereum address of the contract for buying products.
- `w3`: An instance of the Web3 library, which is used to interact with the blockchain.
- `account`: The Ethereum address of the user's account.
- `contract`: An instance of the smart contract being interacted with.
- `buyContract`: An instance of the contract for buying products.
- `portis`: An instance of the Portis wallet.

The `provider` object also has the following methods:

- `logout()`: Logs out the user from the Portis wallet.
- `keccakHash(secretId)`: Hashes a given secret ID using the Keccak256 algorithm.
- `login()`: Logs in the user to the Portis wallet and sets the account.
- `isLoggedIn()`: Checks if the user is currently logged in to the Portis wallet.
- `setAccount()`: Sets the account to the user's current Ethereum address.
- `getAccount()`: Returns the user's Ethereum address.
- `getProvider()`: Returns the Web3 instance.
- `setProvider()`: Initializes the Portis wallet and sets the Web3 instance to use the Portis provider.
- `setContract()`: Initializes the smart contract instance and the buy contract instance.
- `callTransaction(method, parameters)`: Calls a non-transaction method on the smart contract.
- `sendTransaction(method, parameters, toBuy)`: Sends a transaction to the smart contract, either to buy a product or to call a transaction method.

### notes
`contractAddress` is a property in the JavaScript module that interacts with a smart contract on the blockchain. It refers to the Ethereum address of the smart contract being interacted with. The smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. When the conditions of the contract are met, such as the transfer of a certain amount of cryptocurrency, the contract executes itself according to the code written.

`buyAddress` is an Ethereum address of the contract for buying products. It is the address of a smart contract on the blockchain that allows users to purchase products or services using cryptocurrency.

`keccakHash(secretId)` is a function that takes a secret ID as input and returns the Keccak256 hash of the input. Keccak256 is a cryptographic hash function used in Ethereum and other blockchain networks to secure transactions and store data. The keccakHash function is commonly used in smart contract development to securely store and verify data.
